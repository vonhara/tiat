## General info

With this project I try to keep my skills sharp and update my information about PHP.  This is part of my self development plan and also demo from my skills with PHP.

Project has been updated to use only PHP version 8 or newer. Design is almost 10 year old but is still valid.

This is version 10 of this framework and nowadays I use it as lightweight version for demo and prototype purposes. There is also
newer framework which extends this framework capabilities.

## Technologies

* PHP 8.0.0

## Setup

Docker scripts and example application are coming soon...

Constantly maintained
